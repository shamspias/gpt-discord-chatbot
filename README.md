# gpt-discord-chatbot

A simple Python-based Discord chatbot that uses GPT-3 for natural language processing and text generation.

## Overview

This repository contains a basic implementation of a Discord chatbot using Python and GPT-3. The chatbot uses the discord.py library to interact with the Discord API and handle events such as messages, reactions, and more. It also uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to process natural language and generate text based on the user's input. It can be used to create custom commands, automate tasks, and integrate with external APIs.
## Features

- Custom command
- Automated tasks
- Integration with external APIs
- Natural Language Processing and Text Generation using GPT-3

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- `discord.py` library
- OpenAI API Key
- Discord bot token

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/discord-chatbot.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```
